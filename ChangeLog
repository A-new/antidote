09/02/2002 - Bug in searchbackwards prevented an item being ever found.
	Fixed. Version incremented to 0.5.10
09/02/2002 - Previous fix brought a number of new bugs to light - 
	centred around a bug which put an infinite loop into the 
	data structure links. This happened immediately after a suspected
	poisoner was detected and alerted. Fixed - instead of removing
	details from the data structure, we're now resetting replies/requests
	and the timeout, which makes more sense anyway. Version incremented to 
	0.5.9.
06/02/2002 - Fixed bug which made program check MACs in incorrect 
	circumstances, resulting in literally hundreds of false positives. 
	Version incremented to 0.5.8.
06/02/2002 - Fixed bug which made the program always give an error the first
	time an ARP reply was seen, if check_mac_changes is enabled. Impending
	deadlines mean this will almost certainly be the submitted version.
	Updated most of the documentation, and changed copyright notice
	to reflect current status.
	Version incremented to 0.5.7.
04/02/2002 - Changed so that as soon as an alert is sent, details are reset. 
	Also made alerts for unusual numbers of ARP replies more informative.
	This makes the number and content of alerts somewhat saner.
	Version incremented to 0.5.6.
28/01/2002 - Fixed bug introduced in 0.5.4 which prevented MAC details
	from being stored. Version incremented to 0.5.5.
15/01/2002 - Fixed bug in checktimeouts() in audit.c which caused a segfault
	if details at either end of the list were due for timeout. Also fixed
	typo in antidote.h which prevented compilation in systems which
	do not define ETH_ALEN.

	Also prevented storing of MACs when we do not know the target MAC.
	Changed version to 0.5.4
14/01/2002 - Found in handlereply - it calls populateipspace, which always 
	fills the detail space with the senders details. Amended 
	handledata.c with populateipspacereq, populateipspacerep and
	turned populateipspace into a wrapper. Changed antidote.c to
	avoid using these wrappers where possible for speed reasons.
	
	Also fixed bug where broadcast ARPs cause an alert - ARP requests are
	no longer checked for matching MACs.
	Changed version to 0.5.3
08/01/2002 - Found bug in BSD port - the program appears to be treating
	MAC addresses as 12 bytes long (should be 6). ETH_ALEN is defined
	as 6 by linux/if_ether in linux, and if undefined, is defined
	as 6 in antidote.h, so something there is messing up.	
06/01/2002 - Sorted a number of potential portability issues, mainly with
	use of preprocessor directives. Remaining issues are in 
	src/porting.txt. Version number incremented to 0.5.2
05/01/2002 - Changed to_ms in pcap_loop call (in antidote.c) from -1 to 10. 
	This allows use of older versions of libpcap (certainly works with
	0.5). Also checked portability to FreeBSD - all fine. Version number 
	incremented to 0.5.1.
04/01/2002 - Put in ifndef ETH_ALEN to increase portability.
21/12/2001 - Implemented support for short command line options. You can now 
	specify a different config file.
	 - Also fully implemented support for a configuration file.
20/12/2001 - Cleared up a number of memory leaks.
19/12/2001 - Completed SMTP support - now checks that the message was sent 
	properly.
18/12/2001 - Full support for options - just set the relevant part of the
	options structure. Also completed autoconf setup.
17/12/2001 - Embryonic SMTP support - will connect to a mail server and 
	send an email in theory, but does not check mail server's replies.
16/12/2001 - Tried to get it to compile with autoconf - info pages give
	typically excellent reference information, and typically lousy 
	tutoring.

Sorry, no logs prior to 16/12/2001
