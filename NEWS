ANTIDOTE
========

A simple implementation to detect and alert the administrator to some of the
more simple elements of suspect behaviour on a network, especially
any that may be indicitave of ARP poisoning.


Notes Specific to This Release
==============================

This is version 0.5.10.

This is the first public release of Antidote. It's already been through about
as much testing as I can realistically subject it to, but it has had little
in terms of peer review.

It should be pretty stable - tests so far have revealed no memory
leaks, corruption or crashing.

This release supports the following features:

* Report suspicious activity via email and syslog
* Check for and alert of MAC:IP mapping changes.
* Configurable threshold to define when ARP behaviour appears suspicious

While there are currently no known bugs, please note that Antidote comes with
NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

Licensing
=========

Antidote is released under the GNU General Public License.
