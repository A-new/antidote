INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANTIDOTE
======================================

Antidote is an ARP-poison detector tool. To run it, you must be root (or the program must be
setuid root, however, this is not recommended) as it requires direct access to 
the ethernet hardware.

You need libpcap > 0.5 to use this program.

First, uncompress the tarball...

gunzip -c antidote-[version number].tar.gz | tar xvf -

(or tar zxvf antidote-[version number].tar.gz if you have GNU tar)

Then, compile and install the program:

cd antidote-[version number]
./configure
make
make install

For configuration options, type "./configure --help".

The next thing you probably want to do is to create an options file. Antidote
has some sensible defaults configured in antidote.h, however, these will not 
suit everyone, and should be changed using a configuration file.

By default, antidote expects to find a configuration file called antidote.cfg in /etc. 
You can change the default by changing:

#define OPTSFILE "/etc/antidote.cfg"

to:

#define OPTSFILE "<filename>"

in src/antidote.h

Alternatively, you can specify a configuration file at runtime by running 
antidote with the -f option.
